# Daily UI #4 : Calculator
This is another [DailyUi Challenge](https://www.dailyui.co/) task. I implemented some of technologies that ive been learning: Angular, sass, flexbox, responsive, grid layout, ECMAScrip 6, TypeScript and Figma.
I implemented these services too: [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com/), [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

This is a basic calculator can Add, subtract, multiply and divide but the logic needs more additions, you can see how it works in this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mdKPWOGyo&list=PL_soeKKkJIyNXGt9vs2UGbfqWdKGLEgnS). The web page is totally responsive.
