# Daily UI #2 : Credit Card interface
This is the second [DailyUi Challenge](https://www.dailyui.co/) task. I implemented some of technologies that ive been learning: sass, grid layout, flexbox, materialize css animations, JavasCript, ECMAScript 6, Babel and Figma.
I implemented these services too: [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com/), [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html).

This web page records data in real time from validated inputs to credit card design, the credit card type changes about number card. You can see how it works in this [video demo](https://youtu.be/K8Dl2wE5mUo). The web page is totally responsive.

## Deploy
